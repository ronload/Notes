# Bollean Algebra

## Boolean Algebra vs. Allgebra

Diff: 

1. In algebra: If x + y = x + z, then y = z

   In boolean algebra: 1 + 0 = 1 + 1, but 0 is not equal to 1

  2. In algebra: If xy = yz, then y = z

     In boolean algebra: 0 * 0 = 0 * 1, but 0 is not equal to 1

      

## Boolean Algebra

### Conversion of English Sentences to Boolean Equations:

#### Three main steps:

1. Find a switching function that specifies the desired behavior of th circuit.
2. Find a simplified algebraic expression for the function.
3. Realize the simplified function using available logic elements.

#### Example 1

Sentence: Mary watches TV if it is Monday night and she has finished her homework.

Solution:

1. F = Mary watches TV.

   A = It is Monday night.

   B = She has finished her homework.

2. F is true if A and B are both true $\implies$ Boolean equation: F = A*B

#### Example 2

Sentence: The alarm will ring iff the alarm switch is turned on and the door is not closed, or it is after 6 P.M. and the window is not closed.

Solution:

1. Z = The alarm will ring.

   A = The alarm switch is on.

   B = The door is closed.

   C = It is after 6 P.M.

   D = The windows is closed.

2. Boolean equation: Z = (A * B') + (C * D')

3. And the corresponding circuit is:

## Combinational Logic Design using a Truth Table

#### Example 1

Suppose we want the output of a circuit to be:

$f = 1\space if\space N \geq 011_2\space and f = 0\space if\space N\le 011_2$

Then the truth table is:

<img src = "figure 4.2.png" width="40%">

then we have:

$f = A'BC + ABC' + AB'C + ABC' + ABC$

$\implies f = A'BC + AB' + AB$                                <img src = "figure 4.3.png" width = "40%">

$\implies f = A'BC + A\implies A + BC$                     

> Instead of writting in terms of the 1's function,we may alse write f in terms of the 0's of the function.

$f = (A + B + C)(A + B + C')(A + B' + C)$

$\implies f = (A + B)(A + B' + C) = A + B(B' + C) = A + BC$

## Minterm and Maxterm Expansions

### Definition:

1. Minterm of n variables: Product of n literals.
2. Maxterm of n variables: Sum of n literals.

3. If A = B = C = 0, A'B'C' = 1, similarly A = B = 0 and C = 1, A'B'C' = 1and so forth
