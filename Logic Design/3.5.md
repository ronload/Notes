# Providing Validity of an Equatioin

1. Truth table
2. Manipilute one side
3. Reduce both sides of the equation

### Example 1:

Proof: a'bd + bcd + bcd + abc' + ab'd = bc'd' + ad + a'bc

> start with the left side

a'bd + bcd + bcd + abc' + ab'd

# Providing an Equation is not valid

1. First reduce both sides to a **sum of products** or **product of sum**.
2. Compare the two sides.
3. Then try to **add terms** to one side.
4. Finally try to **eliminate terms** from one side.
