# Chapter 7 Relations: The Second Time Around

## 7.1 Relation Revisited: Properties of Relation

**Defination 7.1: Binary Relation**<br>
>For sets A, B, any subset of A $\times$ B is called a *(binary) relation* from A to B. Any subset of A $\times$ B is called a *binary relation* on A.<br>

**Example 7.1**<br>
>Define a relation **R** on set **Z** by a **R** b or (a, b) $\in$ **R**, if a $\leq$ b. This subset of **Z** $\times$ **Z** is the ordinary of "less than or equal to" relation on the set **Z**, and it can also defined on **Q** ro **R**, but not on **C**.

**Defination 7.2: Reflexive**<br>
>A relation **R** on set **A** is called *reflexive* if $\forall$x $\in$ **A**, (x, x) $\in$ **R**.<br>
>To say that a relation is reflexive simply means that each element x for **A** is related to itself.

**Defination 7.3: Symmetric**<br>
>A relation **R** on set **A** is called *symmetric* if (x, y) $\in$ **R** &rArr; (y, x) $\in$ **R**.

**Definaiton 7.4: Transitive**
>For a set **A**, a relation is called *transitive* if $\forall$x, y, z $\in$ **A**, (x, y), (y, z) $\in$ **R** &rArr; (x, z) $\in$ **R**<br>
>So if x is related to y, and y is related to z, we want x is related to z with y playing the role of intermediary.

**Defination 7.5: Antisymmetric**
>Given a relation **R** on set **A**, **R** is called antisymmetric if $\forall$ a, b $\in$ **R**, (a **R** b and b **R** a) &rArr; a = b<br>
>Here the only way we have noth a is relative to b and b is relative to a is if a and b are one and the same element from **A**.
